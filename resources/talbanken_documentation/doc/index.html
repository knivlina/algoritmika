<h1>Swedish Treebank</h1>

<p>The Swedish Treebank is a syntactically annotated corpus of Swedish, created by merging, harmonizing
and partially reannotating two existing corpora, Talbanken [<a href="#T1">1</a>, <a href="#T2">2</a>] 
and the Stockholm-Umeå Corpus (SUC) [<a href="#SUC1">3</a>,<a href="#SUC">4</a>]. The Swedish Treebank
has been created through a collaboration between the Department of Linguistics and Philology at 
Uppsala University and the School of Mathematics and Systems Engineering at Växjö University.
The treebank is distributed by <a href="http://spraakbanken.gu.se/">Språkbanken</a> at the 
University of Gothenburg and is freely available for research and education but requires the user 
to have a license for SUC 2.0. </p>

<p>Below we begin by describing the overall process of merging, harmonizing and reannotating the two source
corpora, and the way in which this process has determined properties of the synthesized treebank. We then 
go on to describe the following aspects of the treebank and its annotation:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#token">Tokenization and sentence segmentation</a></li>
 <li><a href="#morph">Morphological annotation (parts of speech and morphological features)</a></li>
 <li><a href="#synt">Syntactic annotation (phrase structure and grammatical functions, dependency structure)</a></li>
 <li><a href="#enc">Document structure and encoding formats (TIGER-XML, CoNLL dependency format)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We conclude with acknowledgments and references.</p>

<h2>Synthesizing the Swedish Treebank from Talbanken and SUC</h2>

<p><b>Talbanken:</b> Talbanken is a syntactically annotated corpus, containing both written and 
spoken Swedish, produced in the 1970s at the Department of Scandinavian Languages, 
Lund University, by a group led by Ulf Teleman. In total, the corpus contains about 
350,000 tokens, divided into 200,000 tokens of written text (professional prose and
high school essays) and 150,000 tokens of spoken language (interviews, debates, and 
informal conversations). The original annotation, known as MAMBA and described in [<a href="#MAMBA">5</a>], 
consists 
of two layers: a lexical layer, with parts of speech and morphological features, 
and a syntactic layer, with a relatively flat phrase structure and grammatical 
functions. </p>

<p><b>SUC:</b> SUC is a balanced corpus of written Swedish, modeled after the Brown 
Corpus and similar corpora
for English, developed at Stockholm University and at Umeå University 
in a project led by Gunnel Källgren and Eva Ejerhed.
The corpus consists of 1.2 million tokens of text from a variety of 
different genres, the corpus encoding follows the guidelines of the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and the annotation includes lemmatization,
parts of speech, morphological features, and named entities.</p>

<p>In order to merge and harmonize these two corpora into the 
Swedish Treebank, we have adopted the following overall strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harmonize tokenization and sentence segmentation by making Talbanken
conform to the principles of SUC.</li>
<li>Replace the lexical annotation layer in Talbanken with a morphological 
annotation according to the SUC guidelines.</li>
<li>Convert the syntactic annotation layer in Talbanken to a more modern format 
and annotate SUC according to the (converted) Talbanken guidelines.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The overall guiding principle has been to modify SUC as little as possible (given
that it is the larger corpus and also a de facto standard for Swedish) and to make
Talbanken conform to SUC instead of the other way round. The only place where this
is not possible is for the syntactic annotation layer, which is missing in SUC.</p>

<p>Version 1.1 of the Swedish Treebank includes all of SUC but only the professional 
prose section of Talbanken. The annotation is limited to morphology and syntax.
The unified morphological annotation consists of basic parts of speech and morphological 
features following the SUC annotation guidelines. (In addition, the SUC part contains
lemmas, and the Talbanken part contains the original lexical tags according to MAMBA.)
The syntactic annotation mainly consists of phrase structure and grammatical functions 
but has also been converted automatically to dependency structure using head percolation 
rules. The status of harmonization and manual revision is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Tokenization and sentence segmentation in Talbanken has been modified to fit the principles of SUC.</li>
<li>Morphological annotation has been manually checked and revised in both Talbanken and SUC.</li>
<li>Syntactic annotation of phrase structure and grammatical functions has been partially checked 
in Talbanken (after automatic conversion from the old format). In SUC the syntactic annotation has been
performed automatically using a parser trained on Talbanken and has been manually revised only in a small 
subset consisting of about 20,000 tokens. In addition, syntactic structures that clearly deviate from the
annotation guidelines have been flagged automatically as probable parsing errors throughout the SUC part
of the treebank. The conversion to dependency structure, finally, is completely automatic 
and has not been manually validated at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following three sections, we give a brief description of the guidelines for tokenization 
and sentence segmentation, morphological annotation, and syntactic annotation, respectively.</p>

<a name="token"><h2>Tokenization and Sentence Segmentation</h2></a>

<p>Tokenization follows the principles of SUC. Words separated by 
whitespace or punctuation in the original text are considered separate tokens, as are 
punctuation marks. Exception is made for abbreviations containing punctuation and/or 
whitespace, which are kept together as one token with whitespace replaced by an underscore,
e.g., <code>t.ex.</code> and <code>t_ex</code>.</p>

<p>Sentences are segmented according to the principles of SUC, where a sentence is treated as 
the longest sequence of tokens between two major delimiters, defined as one of the punctuation
marks <code>.</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>:</code>, or combinations thereof. In addition, list items are treated
as separate sentences.</p>

<a name="morph"><h2>Morphological Annotation</h2></a>

<p>The morphological annotation consists of part-of-speech categories and morphological features, following
the principles of SUC. Guidelines for these categories can be found in [<a href="#T7">6</a>], except for
the PL category (verb particle), which was not part of the original system but is used in both releases
of the SUC corpus. For PL we have relied on the actual annotation in SUC 2.0 and on internal documentation
from the SUC project. In the Talbanken part we have also retained the original lexical annotation layer
from MAMBA, and in the SUC part we have retained the annotation of lemmas. 
Besides describing the different category systems (and the principles governing the use of the PL
category), we summarize the main principles used for the manual revision of the morphological annotation in Talbanken.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pos.html"> Part-of-speech categories</a></li>
<li><a href="morph.html">Morphological features</a></li>
<li><a href="PL.html">Criteria for use of the PL tag </a></li>
<li><a href="MAMBAlex.html">MAMBA lexical categories</a></li>
<li><a href="morph_revision.html">Principles for manual revision of morphological annotation in Talbanken</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For further information about the part-of-speech categories and the morphological features, 
we refer to [<a href="#T7">6</a>,<a href="#T8">7</a>]. For a description of the lexical
categories inherited from MAMBA, we refer to [<a href="#MAMBA">4</a>].</p>

<a name="synt"><h2>Syntactic Annotation</h2></a>

<p>The primary syntactic annotation of each sentence takes the form of a constituent structure, where 
constituents are labeled with structural categories (phrase types), 
while edges connecting constituents are labeled with functional categories
(grammatical functions) indicating the role of the lower constituent within 
the higher. The set of structural categories used is a small set of conventional
phrase types, such as S for sentence/clause, NP for noun phrase, VP for verb
phrase, etc. The set of functional categories is inherited from the MAMBA 
annotation scheme with a small extension for structures that were not annotated 
in the original version of Talbanken. This annotation has been projected to SUC by 
training a parser on Talbanken, parsing the entire SUC corpus, and manually revising
a small sample of about 20,000 tokens to be used for evaluation purposes, which we will
refer to as the gold standard section of SUC. Sentences
that have not been revised manually have been flagged automatically in case they 
contain configurations of structural and functional categories that are not licensed 
by the annotation scheme. (This is to allow users who are concerned about the quality
of annotation to filter out sentences that contain either a certain number of flags 
or a specific type of flag.) 
Finally, we have automatically converted the constituent structure annotation in both Talbanken 
and SUC, using head percolation rules to determine the head of each phrase and using a 
subset of the grammatical functions to label dependency edges.
Besides describing the different category systems, we summarize the main principles 
used for the manual revision of the syntactic annotation in SUC.</p>

</ul>
<p>For a detailed description of the functional categories inherited from MAMBA,
we refer to [<a href="#MAMBA">4</a>].</p>

<a name="enc"><h2>Document Structure and Encoding Formats</h2></a>

<p>Version 1.1 of the Swedish Treebank is distributed in three different forms with respect to document structure:
<ul>
 <li><b>Document-by-document:</b> One file for each individual document in the original distribution of Talbanken
(85 documents) and SUC (500 documents), respectively.</li>
 <li><b>Train-test split:</b> Talbanken and SUC separately split into about 20,000 tokens for evaluation and the rest of the data
for training of NLP systems. The evaluation data is manually revised in both cases and consists of the gold standard section of SUC together with a matching subset of Talbanken;
the training data is manually revised for Talbanken but only automatically parsed (and flagged) for SUC.</li>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="eval.html">Description of the evaluation set</a></li>
  </ul>
 <li><b>All-in-one:</b> One file for each of Talbanken and SUC containing all the available data (suitable for corpus searches).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Swedish Treebank is primarily encoded in 
<a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html">TIGER-XML</a>, 
which supports easy browsing using 
<a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/TIGER/TIGERSearch/">TIGERSearch</a>, 
a GUI-based tool with advanced search facilities. 
Here is an example of an annotated sentence, as it appears in TIGERSearch:</p>

<p>Nonterminal nodes have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>id:</b> Unique identifier</li>
 <li><b>cat:</b> Structural category of phrase rooted at this node</li>
 <li><b>flags:</b> Flags indicating how the annotation near this node may be erroneous</li>

a de facto standard for dependency treebanks and can be browsed using (for example) 
<a href="http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~jni/malteval/">MaltEval</a>. Here is the same annotated sentence 
as it appears in MaltEval:</p>
